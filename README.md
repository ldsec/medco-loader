# MedCo Loader 
*medco-loader* is a small piece of software used to load data into MedCo, an operational system that makes sensitive medical data available for research in a simple, private and secure way. The current version offers two different loading models: (v0) loading of genomic data; and (v1) loading of encrypted i2b2 data. 
medco-loader is developed by lca1 (Laboratory for Communications and Applications in EPFL).  

## Documentation

* The medco-loader makes use of the [Advanced Crypto (kyber) library](https://github.com/dedis/kyber) and the [UnLynx library](https://github.com/lca1/unlynx) to encrypt the data. 
* For more information regarding the underlying crypto engine please refer to the stable versions of Kyber `github.com/dedis/kyber` and UnLynx `github.com/lca1/unlynx`
* To check the code organisation, have a look at [Layout](https://github.com/lca1/medco-loader/wiki/Layout)
* For more information on how to run the loader, go to [Running medco-loader](https://github.com/lca1/medco-loader/wiki/Running-medco-loader)
